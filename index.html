		<h1>How to eat yummy stuff</h1>
		<p>Hello. This my website. In order to eat yummy stuff, you'll need utensils, or maybe not. All you have to do, is pick up the food with a utensil or your hands, place it into your mouth, and chew repeatedly. After this has been done, you can gulp it dow. And that people, is the secret to eating yummy stuff. Now you can pay me for my troubles. Thanks.</p>
